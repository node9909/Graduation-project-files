# Graduation internship report attachments (HD-SEMG system ADS1298)
 THis folder includes: Hardware files, software files, python application, MATLAB and report, design was to build a protable and wireless HD-SEMG aquisition system for my graduation internship of my electrical engineering degree at Hogeschool Rotterdam, the internship took place at Bio-engineering.pl in Wroclaw.

 The goal of this project was to develop a HD-SEMG aquisition system to better locate the EMG electrodes on the residual limb to improve prosthesis control.

 In the project multiple AFE were designed to amplify and filter the EMG signal. THe EMG channels were digitezed using the ADS1298, the data is read from the ADS1298 via an Arduino DUE (SAM3X8E) and a STM32F4 and a PC application was developed to visualize the data and verifiy certain system specification (CMRR, IRN and Gain).

 If you would like to continue this project Idea, feel to contact me for more info about the future improvements or any other questions about the design of the project.
